          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
          
          Ciao! Iâ€™m Greta, an Italian UX student currently based in The Netherlands.
          
<br> <br>

I was born in a small town located between Verona and Venice, but I spent the last few years backpacking around the world through Oceania, South East Asia and Europe. During these four years of travelling I had the chance to encounter and appreciate the cultural peculiarities of each of the countries I've been living in. Exploring new places made a big impact on me and it certainly boosted my curiosity about the world.
<br> <br>
Other than my travel addiction, I have a genuine passion for audio-visual art and I enjoy spending time discovering new artists, listening to experimental music and immersing myself in a creative atmosphere.</p>

All the prototypes and testing process are described in the following website:            <a  href="https://gretazanin.wixsite.com/bepuxd">click here</a></p>

                    <p>Project Shared Spaces is an ongoing group project started on February where students are asked to design a solution for patients affected with dementia. <br> Our goal is to improve these people's lifestyles and make them move more. <br> So far we've been researching our target group using different methods, such as desk research, fly on the wall (observation), interviews with activities that involve the patients as much as possible. On a second phase, once we'll gather enough data, we'll focus on coming up with a product that will hopefully enhance these people's lives. </p> <br>
                    <p> <a href="#img"> Here below </a> you can find some visuals we made according to our research, which helps us empathizing more with our target group.

                    <h2> The client: </h2>
                    <p class="marginTop"> The Eykenburg Foundation is an organization that takes care of demented people. At Het Zamen location, the current setting of the facility limits the freedom of movement and the possibilities of activity for the residents. The desire for more movement and activity spurts from the positive impact this has on the mental state of the residents. The deterioration of the mind is slowed down, and the residents could feel happier by forming social connections and communication with their environment.

                        With the intent to install new sensor devices in the Het Zamen location, the client would like to make a larger section of the premises available to the residents - the garden, outside halls - and also make residents from different sections interact with each other.

                    </p>

                    <h2>The Assignment</h2>
                    <p>The assignment is to create an environment where demented people in the care of the Eykenburg foundation can freely move around through their own living spaces and the shared spaces like the hallway and the garden, as well as one of the other departments. The goal of this task is to motivate the demented people to get more exercise and to move around more. The benefit of this being that this will slow down the decaying process that is going on in their brains.

                        The challenge will be to rethink the space so that it suits both the residents and the caretakers while ensuring that safety is at the core of the design. Furthermore, the engagement of the space should be improved to give residents a reason to move around and decrease the speed at which their condition worsens.

                        The research phase should uncover effective ways of interaction with demented people, the use of space and technology to create positive differences for the residents and how actions can be triggered for them.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Future Steps:</h2>
                    <p>Now that our research phase is almost over, it's time for us to gather insights and user needs and proceed with the ideation phase: brainstorming, diverging, converging, more reearch, prototyping and testing. </p>
